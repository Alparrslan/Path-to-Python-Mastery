## Structure Overview

The content is divided into three main levels:

### 01-Basic
Fundamentals of Python programming. No prior experience required.

| Notebook | Topics Covered |
|----------|----------------|
| `01_Variables_DataTypes.ipynb` | Integers, floats, booleans, strings, type casting |
| `02_String_Operations.ipynb` | String methods, slicing, formatting |
| `03_Python Collections.ipynb` | Lists, Tuples, Sets, Dictionaries |
| `04_Python Loops.ipynb` | `for`, `while`, `break`, `continue`, nested loops |

---

### 02-Intermediate
Intermediate-level syntax and tools, essential for writing clean and modular code.

| Notebook | Topics Covered |
|----------|----------------|
| `01_Python Function Showcase.ipynb` | Function arguments, scope, return values |
| `02_Comprehensions_examples.ipynb` | List, set, dictionary comprehensions |
| `03_Error Handling and Exception Management.ipynb` | `try/except`, custom exceptions |
| `04_Python Modules & Packages.ipynb` | Importing modules, package structure |

---

### 03-Advanced
Advanced Python concepts used in production-level code and job interviews.

| Notebook | Topics Covered |
|----------|----------------|
| `01_OOP_Basics.ipynb` | Classes, objects, constructors, instance/class variables |
| `02_OOP_Advanced.ipynb` | Inheritance, encapsulation, polymorphism |
| `03_Functional_Programming.ipynb` | `lambda`, `map`, `filter`, `reduce`, immutability |
| `04_Professional_Script_Example.ipynb` | Realistic script structure for maintainable code |
